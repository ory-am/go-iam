# TODO: Remove this file in favor of the main/default Alpine image. The sqlite package is no longer required:
# https://github.com/ory/hydra/blob/master/.docker/Dockerfile-alpine
# However if published to any registry, continue to publish the variant tag but as an alias to standard Alpine image tags:
# https://github.com/ory/hydra/pull/3914#pullrequestreview-2527315326
