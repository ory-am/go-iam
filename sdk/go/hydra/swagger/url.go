// The general form represented is:  [scheme:][//[userinfo@]host][/]path[?query][#fragment]  URLs that do not start with a slash after the scheme are interpreted as:  scheme:opaque[?query][#fragment]  Note that the Path field is stored in decoded form: /%47%6f%2f becomes /Go/. A consequence is that it is impossible to tell which slashes in the Path were slashes in the raw URL and which were %2f. This distinction is rarely important, but when it is, code must not use Path directly. The Parse function sets both Path and RawPath in the URL it returns, and URL's String method uses RawPath if it is a valid encoding of Path, by calling the EscapedPath method.
