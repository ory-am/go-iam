var serveControls = `CORE CONTROLS
=============

- DATABASE_URL: A URL to a persistent backend. Hydra supports various backends:
  - Memory: If DATABASE_URL is "memory", data will be written to memory and is lost when you restart this instance.
  	Example: DATABASE_URL=memory

  - Postgres: If DATABASE_URL is a DSN starting with postgres:// PostgreSQL will be used as storage backend.
	Example: DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@host:123/database

	If PostgreSQL is not serving TLS, append ?sslmode=disable to the url:
	DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@host:123/database?sslmode=disable

  - MySQL: If DATABASE_URL is a DSN starting with mysql:// MySQL will be used as storage backend.
	Example: DATABASE_URL=mysql://user:password@tcp(host:123)/database?parseTime=true

	Be aware that the ?parseTime=true parameter is mandatory, or timestamps will not work.

- SYSTEM_SECRET: A secret that is at least 16 characters long. If none is provided, one will be generated. They key
	is used to encrypt sensitive data using AES-GCM (256 bit) and validate HMAC signatures.
	Example: SYSTEM_SECRET=jf89-jgklAS9gk3rkAF90dfsk

- COOKIE_SECRET: A secret that is used to encrypt cookie sessions. Defaults to SYSTEM_SECRET. It is recommended to use
	a separate secret in production.
	Example: COOKIE_SECRET=fjah8uFhgjSiuf-AS

- PUBLIC_PORT: The TCP port hydra should listen and handle public API requests on.
	Defaults to PUBLIC_PORT=4444

- PUBLIC_HOST: The interface hydra should listen and handle public API requests on. Leave empty to listen on all interfaces.
	Example: PUBLIC_HOST=localhost

- ADMIN_PORT: The TCP port hydra should listen and handle administrative API requests on.
	Defaults to ADMIN_PORT=4445

- ADMIN_HOST: The interface hydra should listen and handle administartive API requests on. Leave empty to listen on all interfaces.
	Example: ADMIN_HOST=localhost

- BCRYPT_COST: Set the bcrypt hashing cost. This is a trade off between
	security and performance. Range is 4 =< x =< 31.
	Defaults to BCRYPT_COST=10

- LOG_LEVEL: Set the log level, supports "panic", "fatal", "error", "warn", "info" and "debug". Defaults to "info".
	Example: LOG_LEVEL=panic

- LOG_FORMAT: Leave empty for text based log format, or set to "json" for JSON formatting.
	Example: LOG_FORMAT="json"

- DISABLE_TELEMETRY: Set to "1" to disable telemetry collection and sharing - for more information please
	visit https://www.ory.sh/docs/ecosystem/sqa
	Example: DISABLE_TELEMETRY="1"

- RESOURCE_NAME_PREFIX: Allows the alternation of the "rn:hydra:" prefix in all resource names declared by ORY Hydra.
	Defaults to "rn:hydra" if empty and removes the last trailing colon.
	Example: RESOURCE_NAME_PREFIX="resources:my-domain.com"


OAUTH2 CONTROLS
===============

- OAUTH2_ERROR_URL: A dedicated endpoint that shows critical errors in a user-friendly way.
	Example: OAUTH2_ERROR_URL=https://id.myapp.com/error

- OAUTH2_CONSENT_URL: The consent provider's URL.
	Example: OAUTH2_CONSENT_URL=https://id.myapp.com/consent

- OAUTH2_LOGIN_URL: The login provider's URL.
	Example: OAUTH2_LOGIN_URL=https://id.myapp.com/login

- OAUTH2_LOGOUT_REDIRECT_URL: The URL where the user's browser will be redirected to after successfully logging out
	of ORY Hydra.
	Example: OAUTH2_LOGOUT_REDIRECT_URL=https://myapp.com/

- OAUTH2_ISSUER_URL: This is the public URL of your ORY Hydra installation. It is used for OAuth2 and OpenID Connect and must be
	specified and using HTTPS protocol, unless --dangerous-force-http is set.
	Example: OAUTH2_ISSUER_URL=https://hydra.myapp.com/

- OAUTH2_CLIENT_REGISTRATION_URL: This is the path to the OAuth 2.0 Client Registration endpoint (as defined by OpenID
	Connect Dynamic Client Registration). Leave this value empty, if that endpoint is not publicly accessible.

- AUTH_CODE_LIFESPAN: Lifespan of OAuth2 authorize codes. Valid time units are "ns", "us" (or "µs"), "ms", "s", "m", "h".
	Defaults to AUTH_CODE_LIFESPAN=10m

- ID_TOKEN_LIFESPAN: Lifespan of OpenID Connect ID Tokens. Valid time units are "ns", "us" (or "µs"), "ms", "s", "m", "h".
	Defaults to ID_TOKEN_LIFESPAN=1h

- ACCESS_TOKEN_LIFESPAN: Lifespan of OAuth2 Access Tokens. Valid time units are "ns", "us" (or "µs"), "ms", "s", "m", "h".
	Defaults to ACCESS_TOKEN_LIFESPAN=1h

- REFRESH_TOKEN_LIFESPAN: Lifespan of OAuth2 Refresh Tokens. Valid time units are "ns", "us" (or "µs"), "ms", "s", "m", "h".
	Set REFRESH_TOKEN_LIFESPAN=-1 to disable refresh token expiry (not recommended for high traffic environments).
	Defaults to REFRESH_TOKEN_LIFESPAN=720h

- LOGIN_CONSENT_REQUEST_LIFESPAN: Maximum lifespan of a login and consent request. This specifies the maximum time a user
	may take to complete the login and consent flow, before that requests times out and results in an error. Valid time
	units are "ns", "us" (or "µs"), "ms", "s", "m", "h".
	Defaults to LOGIN_CONSENT_REQUEST_LIFESPAN=15m

- SCOPE_STRATEGY: Set this to DEPRECATED_HIERARCHICAL_SCOPE_STRATEGY to enable the deprecated hierarchical scope strategy.
	This is required if you do not want to migrate to the new wildcard strategy.

- OAUTH2_SHARE_ERROR_DEBUG: Set this to true if you want to share error debugging information with your OAuth 2.0 clients.
	Keep in mind that debug information is very valuable when dealing with errors, but might also expose database error
	codes and similar errors.
	Defaults to OAUTH2_SHARE_ERROR_DEBUG=false

- OAUTH2_ACCESS_TOKEN_STRATEGY: Sets the Access Token Strategy. Defaults to "opaque" which is the recommended strategy
	for usage with ORY Hydra. If set to "jwt", then Access Tokens will be a signed JSON Web Token. The public key
	for verifying the token can be obtained from "./well-known/jwks.json". Please note that the "jwt" strategy is currently
	in BETA and not recommended for production just yet.
	Defaults to OAUTH2_ACCESS_TOKEN_STRATEGY="opaque"


OPENID CONNECT CONTROLS
===============

- OIDC_DISCOVERY_CLAIMS_SUPPORTED: A comma separated list of supported claims to be advertised at the OpenID Connect
	Discovery endpoint /.well-known/openid-configuration. Always adds "sub" to the supported claims.

- OIDC_DISCOVERY_SCOPES_SUPPORTED: A comma separated list of supported scopes to be advertised at the OpenID Connect
	Discovery endpoint /.well-known/openid-configuration. Always adds "offline", "openid" to the supported scopes.

- OIDC_DISCOVERY_USERINFO_ENDPOINT: A URL of the userinfo endpoint to be advertised at the OpenID Connect
	Discovery endpoint /.well-known/openid-configuration. Defaults to ORY Hydra's userinfo endpoint at /userinfo.
	Set this value if you want to handle this endpoint yourself.

- OIDC_DYNAMIC_CLIENT_REGISTRATION_DEFAULT_SCOPE: The OpenID Connect Dynamic Client Registration specification
	has no concept of whitelisting OAuth 2.0 Scope. If you want to expose Dynamic Client Registration, you should set the default
	scope enabled for newly registered clients. Keep in mind that users can overwrite this default by setting the
	"scope" key in the registration payload, effectively disabling the concept of whitelisted scopes.
	Example: OIDC_DYNAMIC_CLIENT_REGISTRATION_DEFAULT_SCOPE=openid,offline,scope-a,scope-b

- OIDC_SUBJECT_TYPES_SUPPORTED: Sets which identifier algorithms (comma-separated) should be supported.
	Can be "public" or "pairwise" or both. Defaults to "public". Please note that "pairwise" does not work with the
	JWT OAuth 2.0 Access Token Strategy.
	Example: OIDC_SUBJECT_TYPES_SUPPORTED=public,pairwise

- OIDC_SUBJECT_TYPE_PAIRWISE_SALT: Is the salt of the pairwise identifier algorithm and must be set if pairwise is enabled.
	The length must be longer than 8 characters.

	!! Warning !!
	This value should not be changed once set in production. Changing it will cause all client applications
	to receive new user IDs from ORY Hydra which will lead to serious complications with authentication on their side!

	Example: OIDC_SUBJECT_TYPE_PAIRWISE_SALT=5be780ef690045aebf50845d56acd72c

HTTPS CONTROLS
==============

- HTTPS_ALLOW_TERMINATION_FROM: Whitelist one or multiple CIDR address ranges and allow them to terminate TLS connections.
	Be aware that the X-Forwarded-Proto header must be set and must never be modifiable by anyone but
	your proxy / gateway / load balancer. Supports ipv4 and ipv6.
	Hydra serves http instead of https when this option is set.
	Example: HTTPS_ALLOW_TERMINATION_FROM=127.0.0.1/32,192.168.178.0/24,2620:0:2d0:200::7/32

// serveCmd represents the host command
var serveCmd = &cobra.Command{
	Use:   "serve",
	Short: "Parent command for starting public and administrative HTTP/2 APIs",
	Long: `ORY Hydra exposes two ports, a public and an administrative port. The public port is responsible
for handling requests from the public internet, such as the OAuth 2.0 Authorize and Token URLs. The administrative
port handles administrative requests like creating OAuth 2.0 Clients, managing JSON Web Keys, and managing User Login
and Consent sessions.

It is recommended to run "hydra serve all". If you need granular control over CORS settings or similar, you may
want to run "hydra serve admin" and "admin serve public" separately.

To learn more about each individual command, run:

- hydra help serve all
- hydra help serve admin
- hydra help serve public

All sub-commands share command line flags and the following environment variable names:

` + serveControls,
}

func init() {
	RootCmd.AddCommand(serveCmd)

	// Here you will define your flags and configuration settings.

	// Cobra supports Persistent Flags which will work for this command
	// and all subcommands, e.g.:
	// serveCmd.PersistentFlags().String("foo", "", "A help for foo")

	// Cobra supports local flags which will only run when this command
	// is called directly, e.g.:
	serveCmd.PersistentFlags().BoolVar(&c.ForceHTTP, "dangerous-force-http", false, "Disable HTTP/2 over TLS (HTTPS) and serve HTTP instead. Never use this in production.")
	//serveCmd.PersistentFlags().Bool("dangerous-auto-logon", false, "Stores the root credentials in ~/.hydra.yml. Do not use in production.")

	disableTelemetryEnv, _ := strconv.ParseBool(os.Getenv("DISABLE_TELEMETRY"))
	serveCmd.PersistentFlags().Bool("disable-telemetry", disableTelemetryEnv, "Disable anonymized telemetry reports - for more information please visit https://www.ory.sh/docs/ecosystem/sqa")
