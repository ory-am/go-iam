/**
 * Hydra OAuth2 & OpenID Connect Server
 * Please refer to the user guide for in-depth documentation: https://ory.gitbooks.io/hydra/content/   Hydra offers OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect Core 1.0 capabilities as a service. Hydra is different, because it works with any existing authentication infrastructure, not just LDAP or SAML. By implementing a consent app (works with any programming language) you build a bridge between Hydra and your authentication infrastructure. Hydra is able to securely manage JSON Web Keys, and has a sophisticated policy-based access control you can use if you want to. Hydra is suitable for green- (new) and brownfield (existing) projects. If you are not familiar with OAuth 2.0 and are working on a greenfield project, we recommend evaluating if OAuth 2.0 really serves your purpose. Knowledge of OAuth 2.0 is imperative in understanding what Hydra does and how it works.   The official repository is located at https://github.com/ory/hydra   ### Important REST API Documentation Notes  The swagger generator used to create this documentation does currently not support example responses.

In summary ISO/IEC 29115 defines four levels, broadly summarized as follows.  acr=0 does not satisfy Level 1 and could be, for example, authentication using a long-lived browser cookie. Level 1 (acr=1): Minimal confidence in the asserted identity of the entity, but enough confidence that the entity is the same over consecutive authentication events. For example presenting a self-registered username or password. Level 2 (acr=2): There is some confidence in the asserted identity of the entity. For example confirming authentication using a mobile app (\"Something you have\"). Level 3 (acr=3): High confidence in an asserted identity of the entity. For example sending a code to a mobile phone or using Google Authenticator or a fingerprint scanner (\"Something you have and something you know\" / \"Something you are\") Level 4 (acr=4): Very high confidence in an asserted identity of the entity. Requires in-person identification.
