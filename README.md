## What is Hydra?

At first, there was the monolith. The monolith worked well with the bespoke authentication module.
Then, the web evolved into an elastic cloud that serves thousands of different user agents
in every part of the world.

Hydra is driven by the need for a **scalable, low-latency, in memory
Access Control, OAuth2, and OpenID Connect layer** that integrates with every identity provider you can imagine.

Hydra is available through [Docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/oryam/hydra/) and relies on RethinkDB for persistence. Database drivers are extensible, in case you want to use RabbitMQ, MySQL, MongoDB, or some other database instead.

### Feature Overview

1. **Availability:** Hydra uses pub/sub to have the latest data available in memory. The in-memory architecture allows for heavy duty workloads.
2. **Scalability:** Hydra scales effortlessly on every platform you can imagine, including Heroku, Cloud Foundry, Docker,
Google Container Engine and many more.
3. **Integration:** Hydra wraps your existing stack like a blanket and keeps it safe. Hydra uses cryptographic tokens for authenticate users and request their consent, no APIs required.
The deprecated php-3.0 authentication service your intern wrote? It works with that too, don't worry.
We wrote an example with React to show you what this could look like: [React.js Identity Provider Example App](https://github.com/ory-am/hydra-idp-react).
4. **Security:** Hydra leverages the security first OAuth2 framework **[Fosite](https://github.com/ory-am/fosite)**,
encrypts important data at rest, and supports HTTP over TLS (https) out of the box.
5. **Ease of use:** Developers and Operators are human. Therefore, Hydra is easy to install and manage. Hydra does not care if you use React, Angular, or Cocoa for your user interface.
To support you even further, there are APIs available for *cryptographic key management, social log on, policy based access control, policy management, and two factor authentication (tbd)*
Hydra is packaged using [Docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/oryam/hydra/).
6. **Open Source:** Hydra is licensed Apache Version 2.0
7. **Professional:** Hydra implements peer reviewed open standards published by [The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETFÂ®)](https://www.ietf.org/) and the [OpenID Foundation](https://openid.net/)
and under supervision of the [LMU Teaching and Research Unit Programming and Modelling Languages](http://www.en.pms.ifi.lmu.de). No funny business.
8. **Real Time:** Operation is a lot easier with real time monitoring. Because Hydra leverages RethinkDB, you get real time monitoring for free:

## Quickstart

This section is a quickstart guide to working with Hydra. In-depth docs are available as well:

* The documentation is available on [GitBook](https://ory-am.gitbooks.io/hydra/content/).
* The REST API documentation is available at [Apiary](http://docs.hdyra.apiary.io).

### Installation

**Starting the host** is easiest with docker. The host process handles HTTP requests and is backed by a database.
Read how to install docker on [Linux](https://docs.docker.com/linux/), [OSX](https://docs.docker.com/mac/) or
[Windows](https://docs.docker.com/windows/). Hydra is available on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/oryam/hydra/).

The easiest way to start docker is without a database. Hydra will keep all changes in memory. But be aware! Restarting, scaling
or stopping the container will make you **lose all data**:

```
$ docker run -d -p 4444:4444 oryam/hydra --name my-hydra
ec91228cb105db315553499c81918258f52cee9636ea2a4821bdb8226872f54b
```

**The CLI client is available at **[gobuild.io](https://gobuild.io/ory-am/hydra)**.

There is currently no installer which adds the CLI to your path automatically. You have to set up the path yourself.
If you do not understand what that means, ask on our [Gitter channel](https://gitter.im/ory-am/hydra).

If you wish to compile the CLI yourself, you need to install and set up [Go](https://golang.org/) and add `$GOPATH/bin`
to your `$PATH`. Here is a [comprehensive Go installation guide](https://github.com/ory-am/workshop-dbg#googles-go-language) with screenshots.

To install the CLI from source, execute:

```
go get github.com/ory-am/hydra
go get github.com/Masterminds/glide
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/ory-am/hydra
glide install
go install github.com/ory-am/hydra
hydra
```

Alternatively, you can use the CLI in Docker (not recommended):

```
$ docker exec -i -t <hydra-container-id> /bin/bash
# e.g. docker exec -i -t ec12 /bin/bash

root@ec91228cb105:/go/src/github.com/ory-am/hydra# hydra
Hydra is a twelve factor OAuth2 and OpenID Connect provider

Usage:
  hydra [command]

[...]
```

### Run the example

![Run the example](dist/run-the-example.gif)

Install the [CLI and Docker Toolbox](#installation). Make sure you install Docker Compose. On OSX and Windows,
open the Docker Quickstart Terminal. On Linux open any terminal.

We will use a dummy password as system secret: `SYSTEM_SECRET=passwordtutorialpasswordtutorial`. Use a very secure secret in production.

**On OSX and Windows** using the Docker Quickstart Terminal.
```
$ go get github.com/ory-am/hydra
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/ory-am/hydra
$ DOCKER_IP=$(docker-machine ip default) docker-compose build
WARNING: The SYSTEM_SECRET variable is not set. Defaulting to a blank string.
rethinkdb uses an image, skipping

```

**On Linux.**
```
$ go get github.com/ory-am/hydra
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/ory-am/hydra
$ DOCKER_IP=localhost docker-compose build

[...]
```

You have now a running hydra docker container! Additionally, a RethinkDB image was deployed and a consent app.

Hydra can be managed with the hydra cli client. The client hast to log on before it is allowed to do anything.
When hydra detects a new installation, a new temporary root client is created. The client credentials are printed by
`docker compose up`:

```
mhydra   | mtime="2016-05-17T18:09:29Z" level=warning msg="client_id: d9227bd5-5d47-4557-957d-2fd3bee11035"
mhydra   | mtime="2016-05-17T18:09:29Z" level=warning msg="client_secret: ,IvxGt02uNjv1ur9"
```

The system secret is a global secret assigned to every hydra instance. It is used to encrypt data at rest. You can
set the system secret through the `$SYSTEM_SECRET` environment variable. When no secret is set, hydra generates one:

```
time="2016-05-15T14:56:34Z" level=warning msg="Generated system secret: (.UL_&77zy8/v9<sUsWLKxLwuld?.82B"
```

**Important note:** Please be aware that logging passwords should never be done on a production server. Either prune
the logs, set the required parameters, or replace the credentials with other ones.

Now you know which credentials you need to use. Next, we log in.

**Note:** If you are using docker toolbox, please use the ip address provided by `docker-machine ip default` as cluster url host.

```
$ hydra connect
Cluster URL: https://localhost:4444
Client ID: d9227bd5-5d47-4557-957d-2fd3bee11035
Client Secret: ,IvxGt02uNjv1ur9
Done.
```

Great! You are now connected to Hydra and can start by creating a new client:

```
$ hydra clients create --skip-tls-verify
Warning: Skipping TLS Certificate Verification.
Client ID: c003830f-a090-4721-9463-92424270ce91
Client Secret: Z2pJ0>Tp7.ggn>EE&rhnOzdt1
```

**Important note:** Hydra is using self signed TLS certificates for HTTPS, if no certificate was provided. This should
never be done in production. To skip the TLS verification step on the client, provide the `--skip-tls-verify` flag.

Why not issue an access token for your client?

```
$ hydra token client --skip-tls-verify
Warning: Skipping TLS Certificate Verification.
JLbnRS9GQmzUBT4x7ESNw0kj2wc0ffbMwOv3QQZW4eI.qkP-IQXn6guoFew8TvaMFUD-SnAyT8GmWuqGi3wuWXg
```

Let's try this with the authorize code grant!

```
$ hydra token user --skip-tls-verify
Warning: Skipping TLS Certificate Verification.
If your browser does not open automatically, navigate to: https://192.168.99.100:4444/oauth2/auth?client_id=d9227bd5-5d47-4557-957d-2fd3bee11035&response_type=code&scope=core+hydra&state=sbnwdelqzxyedwtqinxnolbr&nonce=sffievieeesltbjkwxyhycyq
Setting up callback listener on http://localhost:4445/callback
Press ctrl + c on Linux / Windows or cmd + c on OSX to end the process.
```

![OAuth2 Flow](dist/oauth2-flow.gif)

Great! You installed hydra, connected the CLI, created a client and completed two authentication flows!
Your next stop should be the [Guide](#guide).

## Documentation

### Guide

The Guide is available on [GitBook](https://ory-am.gitbooks.io/hydra/content/).

### REST API Documentation

The REST API is documented at [Apiary](http://docs.hdyra.apiary.io).

### CLI Documentation

The CLI help is verbose. To see it, run `hydra -h` or `hydra [command] -h`.

### Develop

Unless you want to test Hydra against a database, developing with Hydra is as easy as:

```
go get github.com/ory-am/hydra
go get github.com/Masterminds/glide
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/ory-am/hydra
glide install
go test ./...
go run main.go
```

If you want to run Hydra against RethinkDB, you can do so by using docker:

```
docker run --name some-rethink -d -p 8080:8080 -p 28015:28015 rethinkdb

# Linux
DATABASE_URL=rethinkdb://localhost:28015/hydra go run main.go

# Docker Terminal
DATABASE_URL=rethinkdb://$(docker-machine ip default):28015/hydra go run main.go
```
